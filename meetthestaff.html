                                Hi, my name is Kayla! I’ve been a dental assistant for over
                                three years, with most of my experience in oral surgery. Now working in general
                                dentistry,
                                I’ve
                                truly found a place where I belong. My favorite part of what I do is connecting
                                with
                                patients—I
                                look forward to seeing each of you every day. I strive to create a caring and

                                environment, because I know visiting the dentist can feel stressful for many.

                                work, I
                                enjoy spending time with my wonderful family, my two playful puppies, and close
                                friends. I’m
                                also building my small business, Haven in the Pines, and continuing to grow in
                                my faith with
                                God. Traveling is another passion of mine, especially when it takes me through
                                beautiful
                                mountain and forest scenery.
